The main purpose of this code is (for me) to learn about ray tracing. It is based on the lectures of Peter Shirley et al.

Instructions:

- Use CMake for debug build

  cmake -B build

  cmake --build build

- Run the built program as:

  build\Debug\ray_tracing.exe >> image.ppm

It should produce an image as below:
